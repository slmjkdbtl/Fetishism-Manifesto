# Fetishism Manifesto

Make games to celebrate your love to certain objects.

* Classification *
Classify games by its content and objects instead of its "play style", like a *fish game*, ten *finger games*, a handful of *toothpaste games*

* Programming *
Write functions that are your favorite actions to your objests, like *Toothpaste:squeeze()*, *Milkbottle:lick()*

* Publication *
Don't explain why you choose this object (no words in the world could possibly explain)
